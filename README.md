### Project Description
This project is a Flask-based backend API that analyzes human facial images to detect emotions, age, gender, and race using the DeepFace deep learning framework. It then generates a set of funny, culturally relevant Malayalam text statuses based on the facial analysis, alongside a natural-sounding Malayalam audio output of these statuses using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are tired of useful apps that actually help them. What the world truly needs is an AI that looks at your face, makes random-but-funny Malayalam comments about your life, and tells them back to you in a dramatic voice‚Äîfor absolutely no reason at all.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The project solves the ‚Äúneed‚Äù for pointless entertainment by creating a web-based AI system that analyzes a user‚Äôs face using DeepFace, then generates funny and sarcastic Malayalam phrases based on detected features like mood, age, and gender. These phrases are also converted into Malayalam speech using gTTS, giving users a humorous and interactive experience that serves no practical purpose except to make them laugh.
